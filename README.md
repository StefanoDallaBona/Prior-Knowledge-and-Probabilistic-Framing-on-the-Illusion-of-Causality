# GitHub repository for "The Role of Prior Knowledge and Probabilistic Framing on the Illusion of Causality".
This GitHub repository contains all the supplementary materials for the experiment titled *"TThe Role of Prior Knowledge and Probabilistic Framing on the Illusion of Causality."* 
The project is also available on OSF (link to the project: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/qf5xm/?view_only=c3c8308055654455b19bfa6ded2473ef). Please read the project (available at [OSF Project](https://osf.io/qf5xm/?view_only=c3c8308055654455b19bfa6ded2473ef) and the related pre-registrations to correctly access the following materials:

**EXPERIMENT 1:**

- **The "Back Translation" folder** contains the results of the back-translation procedure that we used to translate the three conditions in our experiment from Italian to English.
  
- **The "Design Analysis" folder** contains the procedure we used to determine a sample size for the two comparisons and the priors that we intend to use to provide statistical evidence for both H0 and H1.

**EXPERIMENT 2:**

- **The "Design Analysis II" folder** contains the procedure we used to determine inferential risks for our second experiment, which matched experiment 1 numerosity.
